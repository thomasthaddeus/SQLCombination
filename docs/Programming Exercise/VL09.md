- Imagine we would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money.
- Write a query that returns the 1 city that has the highest sum of invoice totals.
- Return both the city name and the sum of all invoice totals. So, which city has the best customers?

FROM invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY Sum_Total DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Task 2 Scenario:

---

- Consider that we know our customers love rock music, and we can decide which musicians to invite to play at the concert.
- Letâ€™s invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset.
- Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.
  **Note**: You should choose the right tables and join them.

---

```SQL
SELECT a.Name, COUNT(g.Name) AS Total_Tracks
FROM artists a
JOIN albums al ON a.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
JOIN tracks t ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN genres g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
WHERE g.Name = "Rock"
GROUP BY a.Name
ORDER BY Total_Tracks DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
